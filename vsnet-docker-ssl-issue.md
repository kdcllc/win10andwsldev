# Visual Studio.NET and Docker issue with SSL Certificates

1. Docker -> Volume -> `%APPDATA%\ASP.NET\Https\{projectName}.pfx` 
2. Docker -> Volume -> `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\UserSecrets\<user_secrets_id>\secrets.json`

Projects must contains `UserSecretsId` element with unique ID which in turned is used to Encrypt the `.pfx` file and corresponds to proper `secrets.json` location. 

Run [dotnet-core-docker-ssl-fix.ps1](./dotnet-core-docker-ssl-fix.ps1)  with the following to fix the issue:
```ps
    .\dotnet-core-docker-ssl-fix.ps1 -docker  -project C:\Dev\Projects\TestMvCProj2\TestMvCProj2.csproj
```

The following is added or updated based on the `UserSecretsId` in secret.json.
```json
    {
        "Kestrel:Certificates:Development:Password": "{UserSecret-GUID}",
        "Kestrel:Certificates:Development:Path": {"/root/.aspnet/https/{ProjectName}.pfx"}
    }
```

In addition the certificate is regenerated with new password `{UserSecretsId}` Id.
